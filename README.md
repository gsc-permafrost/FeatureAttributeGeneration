# FeatureAttributeGeneration

This code was published as a part of GSC Open File 8751 and is intended to generate the final digitized feature layers 
from the point and line files created during digitization. In doing this it populates the attribute tables of the layers
using external data layers such as surficial geology and ground ice information.

Anyone wishing to follow the methods for geomorphic feature mapping outlined in GSC Open File 8751  will need to 
repopulate the majority of the field name lists, dictionaries, and file paths. Because of this the code may need to be
extensively modified to run correctly.

This code requires a licenced version of ArcGIS as it uses the ArcPy library extensively.

Version 1.1 (Open File 8751) was written in the ArcGIS Desktop 10.7 build of Python 2.7.
